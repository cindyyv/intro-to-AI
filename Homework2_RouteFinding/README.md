# Homework 2: Route Finding

## Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing various search algorithms to find optimal routes on a map dataset of Hsinchu City from OpenStreetMap. <br>It includes the implementation of Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Uniform Cost Search (UCS), and A* Search algorithms to compare their effectiveness in finding paths between different locations.

## Tasks
1. Breadth-First Search (BFS):
2. Depth-First Search (DFS):
3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS):
4. A* Search:
5. Testing and Evaluation
   * Compare the performance of BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* Search on predefined test cases.
   * Test cases include finding routes between specific landmarks in Hsinchu City.

## Files Included
* `bfs.py`, `dfs.py`, `ucs.py`, `astar.py`: Scripts containing implementations of BFS, DFS, UCS, and A* Search algorithms respectively.
* `main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for testing and displaying results of route finding algorithms on specified test cases.
