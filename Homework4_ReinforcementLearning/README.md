# Homework 4: Reinforcement Learning with OpenAI Gym Environments

## Overview
This assignment focuses on implementing the Q-learning algorithm in two environments: Taxi-v3 and CartPole-v0 using OpenAI Gym. Additionally, it explores Deep Q-Networks (DQN) in CartPole-v0, providing hands-on experience in reinforcement learning (RL) and deep RL (DRL).

## Tasks
1. Q Learning in Taxi-v3
   * Target an average reward around 8.0 after 3000 training episodes.
2. Q Learning in CartPole-v0
   * Use discretization to adapt Q-learning for continuous state space.
   * Target an average reward above 150 after 3000 training episodes.
3. DQN in CartPole-v0
   * Target an average reward above 195 after 1000 training episodes using deep neural networks.

## Files Included
* `taxi.py`: Implementation for Q-learning in Taxi-v3.
* `cartpole.py`: Implementation for Q-learning with discretization in CartPole-v0.
* `DQN.py`: Implementation for DQN in CartPole-v0 using PyTorch.
* `plot.py`: Utility to visualize training progress with generated reward records.
